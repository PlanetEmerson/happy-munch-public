        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>

        <h2>3. User Obligations</h2>
        <p>You agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide accurate information about your dietary goals and restrictions</li>
            <li>Verify all dietary information, especially regarding allergens and restrictions, directly with restaurant staff</li>

            <li>Respect the intellectual property rights of restaurants and menu creators</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Medical and Dietary Disclaimer</h2>
        <div class="important-notice">
            <h3>⚠️ IMPORTANT HEALTH & SAFETY NOTICE</h3>
            <p><strong>Happy Munch is NOT a medical or nutritional advice application.</strong></p>
            <p>The App provides suggestions and recommendations for informational purposes only. Our technology-powered analysis is designed to help you navigate menus based on your preferences, but:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We do NOT provide medical, nutritional, or dietary advice</li>
                <li>We do NOT diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any medical conditions</li>

                <li>We are NOT a substitute for professional medical or nutritional consultation</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Always consult with qualified healthcare professionals</strong> before making significant dietary changes, especially if you have medical conditions, food allergies, intolerances, or specific nutritional needs.</p>
            <p><strong>For users with food allergies or intolerances:</strong> You must ALWAYS verify ingredients, preparation methods, and potential cross-contamination risks directly with restaurant staff. Never rely solely on our recommendations for allergen safety.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>5. Technology Accuracy and Limitations</h2>
        <p>While we use advanced machine learning and computer vision technology to analyze menus and provide recommendations, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>

            <li>Restaurant menus and recipes change frequently without notice</li>
            <li>Hidden ingredients, cross-contamination, and preparation variations may not be detectable</li>
            <li>Translation and interpretation of foreign language menus may contain errors</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users must independently verify all critical dietary information with restaurants.</p>
